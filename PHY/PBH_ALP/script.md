Good evening, everyone. I'm Tae-Geun Kim from Yonsei University.
Today, I'll present the new way to constrain Axion-Like-Particles.
To do this, We use primordial blackhole as the source of ALPs and
suggest new method which is time-varying decay process.

This study in collaboration with Dr. Yongsoo Jho, professor. Jongchul Park, professor Seongchan Park and student Yeji Park.

The primordial black hole is one of the dark matter candidates.
It is produced at early universe, for example during inflation and emit particles via Hawking radiation.

Let me introduce three major properties of PBH.

First, Hawking temperature of PBH is related to PBH's mass as follows.

Second, if we consider Schwarzschild PBH, the bosonic particles emitted at this temperature, follows the modified Boltzmann distribution by graybody factor.
And this graybody factor can be computed by the BlackHawk program.

Third, we can obtain the lifetime of PBH using this evaporation.
If we let PBH live longer than universe, the mass of PBH should larger than 5 times 10 to the 14 gram.

Photons from PBH is divided two kinds.

The first one is directly emitted from PBH through Hawking radiation.
And second one is from decay of standard model particles emitted from PBH.

The first one is called primary photon and another one is called secondary photon.

If photons come frome extragalaxy, then the expected photon flux is as follows.

To compute this, we give some assumptions to PBH.

First, we assume monochromatic mass distribution.
Second, we assume Schwarzschild type PBH.
Third, these PBHs distributed isotropically.

Compute the differential photon flux and plot it, then it looks like these pictures.
Since photons are from two different origins - primary and secondary, 
the combination of these two kinds of photons shows interesting features - the Dent.

Now, let's turn the topic to ALPs.
Axion like particles are pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken global U(1) symmetry.
ALPs are being actively studied in the inflation, dark matter, relaxion and et cetera.

In universe, ALPs can be produced from Super nova, Sun, Neutron star and PBH which we cover in this presentation.

And it has properties that can decay into 2 photons and mass of ALPs and coupling are independent in general.

ALP's mean life time is defined by mass, coupling constant and energy of ALPs.
In small time scale, it can be considered as constant,
but in sufficiently large time scale, energy is redshifted by universe expansion, so it can be changed.

The left figure represents mean lifetime of ALPs in the rest frame.
The blue dashed line means the age of universe.
In this region we can see quite many areas have lifetimes that are close to age of universe or greater.

In this time scale, since the redshift effect to energy becomes so significant,
mean lifetime can no longer be constant.

Thus, mean lifetime should have time dependency and we write it as follows.

The right figure describes how much lifetime can be changed.

# S7

If we want to see the decay of particles then we solve decay equation.
Now, the decay rate has time dependence, so the solution of decay equation
is not just exponential decay, but includes integration of varying decay rates in its exponential part.

Before calculate differential flux, we should well-define decay model.

To do this, we use the methodology of survival analysis which is a branch of biostatistics.

In survival analysis, the survival function represents the probability that object can alive after time t, and it is same as survival probability in particle decay.
Next, the hazard function represents the differentiation of survival function
and it is same as decay rate in particle decay.

These two are usually used in ordinary particle decay, but because of time-varying decay rate, we need one more thing - probability density function.

In survival analysis, there is failure density function, so we define decay density function which has same definition with this.
